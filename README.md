#Template 3 (one of Elzero web school projects using HTML and CSS):

After completing an HTML and CSS course, I worked on a personal training project
where I tried to create the same template  of Oussama elzero without copying any part of his template's code . This project also helped reinforce my skills in web development, focusing on layout structure, styling,grid and flex concepts...
